My Superpower

Hi, I’m Angel, and my funny story is that I think I’m a magician who can see the future.
Not a powerful one. I can’t see what will happen in 100 years, I can’t see Elon Musk’s future, and 
I can’t even see the future of my cousin who is studying English here in another class.

But I can see my own future sometimes.
I can’t control it, and obviously I haven’t won the lottery.
But every now and then, I suddenly realized that I had already seen the exact moment I was living. I saw it years ago.

The first time I noticed this was when I was playing pool.
Yes, pool.
While I was preparing this speech, I realized that you don’t say pool in English. 
In Argentina, we say pool, but I don’t mean a swimming pool. I love swimming, but this was not playing swim. 
I know this doesn’t make sense.

Later, I found out that in English it’s called billiards.

So, the first time I played billiards, I was right next to the table, holding the billiard stick, 
and aiming at the white ball.
Suddenly, I realized something strange: I had seen that exact scene before, from my own eyes. 
It had happened in a dream a long time ago, but that didn’t help me at all.

Right after that moment, I played terribly, because I didn’t know how to play billiards. 
And my dreams didn’t help me either, because they were just random moments and I couldn’t control them.

Probably, you might say, “That was just déjà vu,” and I agree — and 
those déjà vus have happened to me more than once, not just that time.

But it sounds much better if I say I’m a magician who can see the future.

So for now, this was my story as a magician.
I can’t change the future, but at least it was funny.
